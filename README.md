# ITCSS Emmet Snippets

> Custom snippets for Emmet following the ITCSS pattern

## Prerequisite

[Emmet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmet_(software)) is a set of plugins that allow for high-speed coding and editing in HTML, XML, XSL and other structured code formats (like CSS, SCSS, SASS, LESS, Stylus, etc).

For more information about Emmet, please visit the [official website](https://emmet.io/).

For more information about how Emmet works, please visit the [official documentation](https://docs.emmet.io/).

> Basically, most text editors out there allow you to store and re-use commonly used code chunks, called "snippets". While snippets are a good way to boost your productivity, all implementations have common pitfalls: you have to define the snippet first and you canâ€™t extend them in runtime.

> Emmet takes the snippets idea to a whole new level: you can type CSS-like expressions that can be dynamically parsed, and produce output depending on what you type in the abbreviation. Emmet is developed and optimised for web-developers whose workflow depends on HTML/XML and CSS, but can be used with programming languages too.

## About

ITCSS Emmet snippets is a package which utilizes the power of ITCSS and Emmet and provides a customized, opinionated `snippets.json` file adapted to the ITCSS pattern and providing many useful snippets.

## Installation

In order to use this package you must [download](https://github.com/scriptex/itcss-emmet-snippets/archive/master.zip) it on your local machine, extract it and copy the `snippets.json` file to the preferred location.

You can also download only the [`snippets.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scriptex/itcss-emmet-snippets/master/snippets.json?token=ABDD5E4J4AZPORLHG2OOA5K44ZWF6) file alone.

After that in your preferred text editor, you should set the Emmet extensions path to point to the folder which contains our custom `snippets.json` file.

You can follow the [official documentation](https://docs.emmet.io/customization/snippets/) and overwrite the default snippets, but I would recommend overwriting only the settings for Emmet in your editor.

For example, in VS Code, this is done by adding/editing the following setting:

```json
"emmet.extensionsPath": "PATH_TO_YOUR_SNIPPETS_JSON_FOLDER"
```

In Sublime Text, you should define the `extensions_path` setting in `Emmet.sublime-settings` and make it point to your custom snippets folder.
